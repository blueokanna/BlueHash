# BlueHash Algorithm Documentation - [中文文档](https://github.com/blueokanna/BlueHash/blob/main/README-zh.md)

## Overview

The **BlueHash** algorithm is a custom cryptographic hash function designed to generate secure hash values with varying bit lengths (128, 256, and 512 bits). It utilizes multiple rounds of transformations, including state updates, permutation functions, and constant generation, all of which contribute to the uniqueness and security of the final hash output.

This documentation provides an explanation of the algorithm's core components, including the state size, round counts, constant generation, and state update transformations. Mathematical formulas are provided to describe each step in the process.

## Key Components

### 1. State Size and Digest Length

The **BlueHash** algorithm uses a fixed state size and different digest lengths based on the desired output size.

- **State Size**: 25 64-bit words, i.e., \( STATE\_SIZE = 25 \).
- **Digest Length**: Based on the digest size, which can be 128, 256, or 512 bits.

The number of rounds and the output length for each digest size are as follows:

$$
R(d) = 
\begin{cases} 
56, & \text{if } d = 128 \text{ bits} \\
64, & \text{if } d = 256 \text{ bits} \\
80, & \text{if } d = 512 \text{ bits}
\end{cases}
$$

$$
L(d) = 
\begin{cases} 
16, & \text{if } d = 128 \text{ bits} \\
32, & \text{if } d = 256 \text{ bits} \\
64, & \text{if } d = 512 \text{ bits}
\end{cases}
$$


### 2. Constants Generation

The `generate_constants` function generates a unique constant for each round of the hash transformation. The constant is based on several factors, including the round number, input data, and predefined constants.

The constant is generated using the following formula:

$$
\text{constant} = \left( p \ll (r \mod 64) \right) \times \left( r + \text{round factor} \right) \ll 32 + \left( r + \text{round factor} \right) \gg 16 + \text{extra prime} \ll (r \mod 32) + \text{noise} \ll 8 + \text{hash length}
$$



Where:
- \( p \) is a fixed prime constant.
- \( r \) is the round number.
- `round_factor` is a function of the round number.
- `extra_prime` is a large constant prime.
- `noise` is generated from the input data and round number.
- `hash_length` is the length of the final digest.

This ensures that each round has a unique constant, enhancing the security and randomness of the hash process.

### 3. State Update and Permutation

The `update` and `permute` functions implement the core transformation logic of the algorithm. Each round involves updating the state using the current round constants and applying various bitwise operations to achieve diffusion and confusion.

The update formula for the state \( \text{state}[i] \) at round \( r \) is as follows:

$$
\text{state}[i] = \left( \text{state}[i] \ll 29 \right) + \text{constant} + \text{local\ vars}[2] \oplus \left( \text{local\ vars}[0] \land \text{local\ vars}[1] \right) \oplus \left( \text{local\ vars}[3] \gg 17 \right) \oplus \left( \text{constant} \ll 23 \right)
$$

Where:
- `state[i]` is the `i^{th}` element of the state array.
- `local vars` are variables derived from neighboring state values.
- `<<` and `>>` represent bitwise left and right shifts, respectively.
- `⊕` represents the bitwise XOR operation.
- `&` represents the bitwise AND operation.


This transformation ensures that each round of the hash function introduces non-linear mixing, which helps in achieving both diffusion (small input changes lead to large output changes) and confusion (output is not easily related to the input).

### 4. Finalizing the Hash

The final hash is produced by extracting bits from the internal state after all rounds of transformations are complete. The final digest is generated by taking chunks of 64 bits from the state and converting them to bytes.

The formula for generating the final digest is:

$$
\text{digest}[j] = \text{state}\left[\frac{j}{8} \mod \text{STATE\ SIZE}\right]
$$


Where:
- `digest[j]` is the `j^{th}` byte of the final hash.
- `state[j / 8 mod STATE_SIZE]` represents the value taken from the state array.


The resulting bytes are concatenated to form the final hash value, which is the output of the `finalize` function.

### 5. Correctness and Security

The security of the **BlueHash** algorithm is based on the following principles:

- **Uniqueness**: Each round uses a unique constant that depends on the round number, input data, and a series of primes. This ensures that no two rounds produce the same transformation.
- **Collision Resistance**: The non-linear transformations and mixing of state variables at each round make it computationally difficult to find two distinct inputs that produce the same hash output.
- **Diffusion and Confusion**: The bitwise operations (XOR, AND, shifts) used in the state update function ensure that small changes in the input lead to significantly different hash values, which is the essence of a good cryptographic hash function.

By adhering to these principles, **BlueHash** is designed to be a robust cryptographic hash function, resistant to attacks such as collision finding and pre-image attacks.

# Final

The **BlueHash** algorithm is a custom cryptographic hash function that leverages multiple rounds of complex transformations to generate secure hashes of varying lengths. It utilizes a fixed state size, round-based transformations, and constant generation to ensure the uniqueness and security of the final output.
